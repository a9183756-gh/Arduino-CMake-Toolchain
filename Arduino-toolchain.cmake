#=============================================================================
# A toolchain for the Arduino compatile boards.
# Please refer to README.md for the usage.

#*****************************************************************************
# If not using the required CMake version, exit with error
#
# Intended to support CMake version 3.0.0, but there are limitations which
# requires a minimum CMake version of 3.7.0. However, wherever possible, the
# toolchain remains compatible with 3.0.0, looking for some workarounds for
# the limitations in the future. The limitations are captured below.
#
# Version below 3.2.0 has no support for continue() command. Can be fixed.
#
# Version below 3.4.0 has no support for target properties BINARY_DIR,
# SOURCE_DIR etc. These are required in target command generator expressions.
#
# Version below 3.6.0 has issues in identifying try_compile output for 
# static library. So there are some errors during the configuration, but
# may still possibly work.
#
# Version below 3.7.0 has no support for CMAKE_SYSTEM_CUSTOM_CODE, which
# is required when there is some dynamic information, like Board options,
# that needs to be included in the toolchain. Here just including the user
# provided path will not work, because the user variables, cache or root
# binary directory path etc. are not passed to try_compile.
