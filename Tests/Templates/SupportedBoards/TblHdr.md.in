# List of supported Arduino boards

Following are the list of boards known to be supported or not supported using
the [Arduino CMake toolchain][1]. This list is a result of tests done on the
official and 3rd party list of Arduino platforms maintained in the 
[Arduino Wiki][2]. For the up-to-date results, you may also visit the
[nightly CDash build results][3].
